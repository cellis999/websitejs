To interact with the project use the pages link. On the pages link you can create a deck by clicking the add deck button and filling out the forms (sometimes you have to scroll to find the add deck on the bottom left)
You then can search to add any magic the gathering card using the add card search bar, and as long as it is spelled the same, the image should populate.

Heres an easy example card if you don't know any:
Counterspell

Feel free to try any MTG card though, its accessed from the scryfall api.
